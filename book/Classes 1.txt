Class Features 
All of the following are class features of the archer. 
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An archer is proficient with all simple weapons, all bows, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Archers are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). An archer can cast archer spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal spell failure chance. However, like any other spellcaster, an archer wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass archer still incurs the normal spell failure chance for spells received from other classes. 
Spells: An archer casts black magic spells, which are drawn from the wizard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every archer spell is imbued into a fired arrow or crossbow bolt, and thus an arrow or bolt is required to cast a spell. The spell's effect is centered on the impact of the arrow. If it is not an area effect spell, the spell has the normal effect on the target, but uses the range of the weapon. The bolt or arrow is rendered useless and considered lost weather it reaches its target or not. To learn or cast a spell, an archer must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an archer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the archer's Intelligence modifier. 
Like other spellcasters, an archer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Archer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score. When Table: Archer Spells Known indicates that the archer gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Intelligence score for that spell level. 
The archer's selection of spells is extremely limited. An archer begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. At most new archer levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Archer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an archer knows is not affected by his intelligence score; the numbers on Table: Archer Spells Known are fixed.) 
Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third archer level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), an archer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the archer “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level archer spell the archer can cast. An archer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. 
As noted above, an archer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. 
Archer's Knowledge: An archer may make a special archer's knowledge check with a bonus equal to his archer level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the archer has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.) 
A successful archer's knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. An archer may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random. 

DC Type of Knowledge 
10 Common, known by at least a substantial minority drinking; common legends of the local population. 
20 Uncommon but available, known by only a few people legends. 
25 Obscure, known by few, hard to come by. 
30 Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it, possibly known only by those who don’t understand the significance of the knowledge. 

Bonus Archer Feats: The archer gains bonus feats at the levels indicated in the Table: The Archer. These feats can be chosen from the following list: Point Blank Shot, Far Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, Shot on the Run, Improved Precise Shot, and Manyshot. He may choose these feats even if he has not met the normal prerequisites (the only exception to this is Improved Precise Shot. In this case he must at least have Precise Shot first.) The archer may choose any other feat in exchange for a bonus feat if he has met all of its prerequisites. 
These bonus feats are in addition to the feats gained by a character of any class from advancing levels. 

PRIEST (Cleric) 
Alignment: Any Good.

Class Skills 
The priest's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

Class Features 
All of the following are class features of the priest. 
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Priests are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields (except tower shields). 
Spells: A priest casts white magic spells, which are drawn from the priest spell list. A priest must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below). 
To prepare or cast a spell, a priest must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a priest's spell is 10 + the spell level + the priest's Wisdom modifier. 
Like other spellcasters, a priest can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Priest. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. 
Priests meditate or pray for their spells. Each priest must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a priest can prepare spells. A priest may prepare and cast any spell on the priest spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation. 
Spontaneous Casting: A priest can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the priest did not prepare ahead of time. The priest can “lose” any prepared spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with “cure” in its name). 

SUMMONER (Druid) 
Alignment: Any. 
Hit Die: d8. 

Class Skills 
The summoner's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Class Features 
All of the following are class features of the summoner. 
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Summoners are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. 
Summoners are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. 
A summoner who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast summon spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter. 
Spells: A summoner casts summon spells, which are drawn from the summoner spell list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A summoner must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below). 
To prepare or cast a spell, the summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner's spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner's Charisma modifier. 
Like other spellcasters, a summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Summoner. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score. 
A summoner prepares and casts spells the way a priest does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place. A summoner may prepare and cast any spell on the summon spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation. 
Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: A summoner can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own. Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions. 
Wild Empathy (Ex): A summoner can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The summoner rolls 1d20 and adds her summoner level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. 
The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. 
To use wild empathy, the summoner and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. 
A summoner can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check. 
Woodland Stride (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a summoner may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her. 
Venom Immunity (Ex): At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons. 

FIGHTER (Fighter) 
Alignment: Any. 
Hit Die: d10. 

Class Skills 
The fighter’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Ride (Dex), and Swim (Str).

Class Features 
All of the following are class features of the fighter. 
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields (including tower shields). 
Bonus Feats: At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The fighter gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every two fighter levels thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats. A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums. 
These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. A fighter is not limited to the list of fighter bonus feats when choosing these feats.

Class Features 
All of the following are class features of the monk. 
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Monks are proficient with club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and sling. 
Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields 
When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities. 
AC Bonus (Ex): When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level). 
These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load. 
Flurry of Blows (Ex): When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. The resulting modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of Blows Attack Bonus column on Table: The Monk. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make before her next action. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must use a full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows. 
When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus x 1-1/2 or x1/2) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The monk can’t use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows. 
In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse unarmed strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so. 
When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus. 
Unarmed Strike: At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk’s attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes. 
Usually a monk’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling. 
A monk’s unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons. 
A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table: The Monk. The unarmed damage on Table: The Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.

At 6th level, she may select either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them. 
Evasion (Ex): At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion. 
Fast Movement (Ex): At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed, as shown on Table: The Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed. 
Still Mind (Ex): A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment. 
Ki Strike (Su): At 4th level, a monk’s unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. Ki strike improves with the character’s monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness. 
Slow Fall (Ex): At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm’s reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk’s ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her descent and fall any distance without harm. 
Purity of Body (Ex): At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases. 
Wholeness of Body (Su): At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out among several uses. 
Improved Evasion (Ex): At 9th level, a monk’s evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion. 
Diamond Body (Su): At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds. 
Diamond Soul (Ex): At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk’s spell resistance. 
Quivering Palm (Su): Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + the monk’s Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time. 
Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.
